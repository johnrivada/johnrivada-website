Elias. Yes. That will be you. You reading this. Your name will be Elias.

The biggest problem with writing these blog posts is never knowing <i> who </i> I'm writing for. So here we are. I am designating you, the reader as Elias. This will give me a person, a one man audience, to write to, to give me a direction for all these posts. Why Elias? I don't know. It was just the first name to show up in my head. Elias is a name of an NPC in my D&D setting so it'llb e a little weird because at times it'll feel like I'm writing to a fictional fantasy character but who knows maybe that'll be easier... or maybe it won't.

Okay thanks Elias!
